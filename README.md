# Tic-Tac-Toe #

My version of the age old game tic-tac-toe


///--------------------------------------------V2---------------------------------------------///
Decided to Take Jarids Challenge and Create an AI. I started out with a simple AI that would choose a random box number between 0 and 8
This version works well.

v2.1
	I took the randomized AI code from v2 and tried to put logic in it, so the computer would think of possible wins before it chooses a number.
	this version was a failure the AI wasn't good at finding or selecting the correct possible wins

v2.2
	was a bit better, the AI would know what tiles to choose for to win, but if there was ever a point durning a match where there was no possible wins, AI was a poor sport and GAVE UP. I couldn't correct this behavior mainly due to messy code

OVERALL v2 has messy code, Creating v3....
